Fault Tolerant Routing Protocol

By Zi Yang Zhang(260396312) and Nien Fang Cheng(260414039)

Instruction:

Input file format is as follows:

#Starting point as binary(eg. 011)

#Destination point as binary(eg. 111)

#Dimension of the graph(eg. 3)

#Faulty links seperate by comma(eg. 011-010,011-111), put nothing if non-fault network(optional)

==========================================================================================================================
Causion: The Dimension has to accord with starting point dimension, inconsistance starting point with dimension will cause unpredictable behaviour
==========================================================================================================================

To start the application, run: python FTRouting.py under current directory.

The application will ask for the path of the input file as input(eg. input.txt if under current directory)
